# Pomodoro Timer CLI

A simple Pomodoro timer CLI application built with TypeScript that helps you manage your work and break sessions. The app notifies you when work or break time starts and updates progress with a visual progress bar.

## Features

- **Work Timer**: A timer that helps you focus on tasks for a specific duration (default: 25 minutes).
- **Break Timer**: A timer that allows you to take short breaks after completing a work session (default: 5 minutes).
- **Progress Bars**: Visual progress bars show the remaining time for work and break sessions.
- **Notifications**: Desktop notifications are shown when a work or break session starts.
- **Interactive CLI**: The application offers a menu for starting a session, adjusting session times, or exiting.
